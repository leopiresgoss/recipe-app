The Recipe app keeps track of all your recipes and ingredients. The app will allow you to save ingredients, keep track of your items, create recipes, and generate a shopping list based on the ingredients from your recipes. Also, since sharing recipes is an important part of cooking the app allows you to make them public so anyone can access them.
